    "* $\\theta$ denotes unobservable _vector_ quantities or population parameters, like the probability of survival in a clinical trial.\n",
    "* $y=(y_1, \\ldots, y_n)$ denotes the _observed_ data (e.g. number of survivors in each treatment arm). These are also called _outcomes_. \n",
    "* $\\tilde{y}$ denotes unknown but potentially observable quantities, e.g. outcomes of similar patients to the ones in our trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general:\n",
    "* All symbols represent multivariate quantities.\n",
    "* Greek letters denote \"parameters\".\n",
    "* Lower case Roman letters for observed scalars/vectors (or possibly matrices).\n",
    "* Upper case Roman letters denote observed or observable matrices.\n",
    "* Vector means column vector. $u^Tu$ is a scalar; $uu^T$ is a square matrix.\n",

    "_Explanatory variables_ or _covariates_ are observations on each unit that are not modeled as random, such as the age of a patient. These are usually denoted $x$, and the full set of explanatory variables for all observations is denoted $X$. If there are $k$ varibles, and $n$ members of the population, then $X$ is has $n$ rows and $k$ columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the goal of Bayesian inference is to gain information about a parameter $\\theta$ or unobserved data $\\tilde{y}$ given the observed data $y$, written $P(\\theta|y)$ or $P(\\tilde{y}|y)$. (TODO: Probability Notation, p. 6)."
