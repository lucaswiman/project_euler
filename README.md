# Parsimonious examples

Several toy parsimonious grammars, with associated tests:
- iso8601 (timestamp)
- csv
- Parenthesized arithmetic expressions

Each grammar has some associated examples and non-examples.

## Running the tests
```
tox
```

## Inspecting an individual grammar

To run through all the examples and show how they are parsed, do
```
python -m examples.whatever_grammar
```
